# Task 3 -  Performing Machine Learning model using Spark MLlib

I have used `Google Colab` for this task.

Upload the `task_3.ipynb` notebook file to the Colab and execute each step.

* Note: Upload the `locationData.csv` and `weatherData.csv` files to the Colab runtime before executing the steps.
